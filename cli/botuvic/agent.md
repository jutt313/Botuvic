# Overview of the botuvic/agent Directory

The `botuvic/agent` directory is designed to encapsulate the core functionalities of your AI agent application. Here's a brief breakdown of its contents:

1. **system_prompt.py**: This file likely manages the prompts and interactions, serving as the interface between the user and the agent, guiding the user's input.

2. **core.py**: The heart of the agent, implementing key logic and processes. It contains the main business logic, AI operations, or decision-making algorithms.

3. **__init__.py**: Initializes the agent package, ensuring it's recognized as a module and linking submodules or functions.

4. **utils**: Contains helper functions and utilities that support the agent's operations, such as storage handling or searching capabilities.

5. **functions**: Manages specialized tasks, such as executing specific operations or structuring project components.

Overall, the structure supports a flexible and modular AI system, making development, testing, and enhancement more manageable.
